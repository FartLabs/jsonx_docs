# JSX

JSX is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript that allows programmers to
write HTML-like code in JavaScript. JSX code is transformed into standard
JavaScript through transpilation.

## Transpilation

Here is some JSX code that renders a simple greeting message in HTML:

```tsx
function Greeting(props: { name: string }) {
  return (
    <DIV>
      <H1>Hello, {props.name}!</H1>
    </DIV>
  );
}

const html = <Greeting name="World" />;

console.log(html);
```

Here's the same code transpiled to JavaScript:

```js
function Greeting(props) {
  return h(DIV, null, h(H1, null, "Hello, ", props.name, "!"));
}

const html = h(Greeting, { name: "World" });

console.log(html);
```

The JSX syntax is shorthand for calling the JSX runtime function `h` with the
component, its props, and any children. `h` is conventionally used to represent
the `createElement` function in [React](https://react.dev/),
[Preact](https://preactjs.com/),
[Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/render-function#jsx-tsx), and other JSX
runtimes, but it can be configured to use any function via the `jsxFactory` and
`jsxFragment` options in the TypeScript compiler options.

## Syntax

JSX syntax is similar to HTML, but it is not HTML. For example,
[void elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element)
like `<img>` require a closing slash (`<img />`), and all tags must be closed.

JSX also supports dynamic expressions between `{` and `}`. This is how data is
dynamically inserted into JSX elements.

```tsx
function PokemonLink(props: { pokedexNumber: number }) {
  return (
    <A href={`/pokedex/${props.pokedexNumber}`}>
      Pokemon #{props.pokedexNumber}
    </A>
  );
}
```

## Project setup

### Deno

Configuring JSX runtimes with Deno is easy peasy lemon squeezy! üçã

If the Deno toolchain is not already installed on your system,
[install Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation).
Run [`deno upgrade`](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/upgrade) to
ensure you have the latest version.

Initialize a new Deno project with the
[`deno init`](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/init) subcommand.

#### Configuring one JSX runtime in Deno

To configure a JSX runtime across your entire Deno project, edit your Deno
configuration file's compiler options according to your JSX runtime of choice.

For example, [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) (Deno's next-gen web framework),
uses Preact as its JSX runtime and is configured as follows:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "preact"
  }
}
```

In this example, the `jsx` option is set to `"react-jsx"` which tells the
compiler how to handle JSX syntax for Preact.

The `jsxImportSource` option is set to `"preact"` which tells the compiler where
to import the JSX runtime from e.g. the compiler will import its JSX runtime
from `"preact/jsx-runtime"`. To make sure the compiler can find the JSX runtime,
an import alias is assigned to a module that exports the JSX runtime. Since
`https://esm.sh/preact/` exports the JSX runtime, the alias `preact/` is
assigned to this module in your Deno configuration file:

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "preact/": "https://esm.sh/preact/"
  }
}
```

This is how a Fresh project is configured to use Preact as its JSX runtime in
Deno!

#### Configuring multiple JSX runtimes in Deno

The Deno configuration file is only capable of configuring one JSX runtime at a
time. If you need to use multiple JSX runtimes in your project, you can use the
`--config` flag to specify a different configuration file for each runtime.

Another available option is to override the `jsx` and `jsxImportSource` values
in your project's Deno configuration file in each file that uses a different JSX
runtime e.g.:

```tsx
/** @jsx react-jsx */
/** @jsxImportSource @fartlabs/jsonx */
```

This alternative approach allows different JSX runtimes to be used in different
files and is easier to manage than using multiple configuration files.

## Q&A

### What does JSX stand for?

JSX stands for "JavaScript XML".

### What is JSX known for?

JSX is most commonly known for being a paradigm for writing web applications and
is used by multiple popular libraries such as React and Preact to define and
compose user interfaces at scale.

React is downloaded over 100 million times per week and is the tool of choice
behind many popular platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.

### What is the difference between JSX and TSX?

TSX refers to TypeScript code with JSX syntax. JSX files are often denoted by
the file extension `.jsx` while TSX files are denoted by the file extension
`.tsx`.

It is recommended to use TSX files when writing JSX code in TypeScript projects.
This is because TypeScript offers type checking that can help catch errors early
in the development process.

Learn more about [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/).

### Why do JSX components only use a single argument?

JSX's constraint of limiting components to functions with a single object
argument is a fundamental aspect of its composability.

This argument, often referred to as "props", consolidates all the data a
component needs into one place, simplifying how information is passed to
components and how components are defined.

In essence, JSX's single object argument constraint promotes a structured and
predictable way to pass data between components, which is essential for building
complex programs by composing smaller, reusable pieces.

### Why does jsonx use JSX?

JSX is leveraged by jsonx to provide a familiar and expressive way to define
components. This allows developers to define complex structures in a more
readable and maintainable way.

Traditionally, JSX is associated with HTML and web development, but jsonx
extends its use to define components for any problem domain that can be
expressed in JavaScript/TypeScript and JSON.
