# Playgrounds Manual

Playgrounds are useful for trying out jsonx code snippets, sharing code, and
learning jsonx.

- Edit, transpile, and play playground code in the browser.
- Share your playground with others.

## Use

To use a playground, let's take a look at the parts that make up one playground:
code editor, version dropdown, play button, console, and share button.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Screenshots of playground parts are coming soon!

### Code editor

The code editor is where you edit code. It is a TypeScript environment that
comes with batteries-included for editing jsonx code.

### Version dropdown

The version dropdown allows you to select the version of jsonx you want to use.
The default version is the latest stable version found on
[jsr.io](https://jsr.io).

### Play button

The play button transpiles and executes the code in the code editor. Output is
displayed in the provided console.

### Console

The console displays the output of the code executed in the code editor.

The clear button clears the console.

### Share button

The share button generates a link to the playground and navigates the user to
the new link. The link is unlisted (not indexed by search engines) and can be
shared with others.

## Recovery and disposal

> [!NOTE]
>
> The "Recovery and Disposal" form will be coming soon.

Since playground links are unlisted, losing the link means losing the
playground. In case you lose a playground, first check your browser history for
the link. In case the playground is important and unrecoverable, you can use the
form to file a ticket with the jsonx team so we can help you recover it.
Similarly, if you have a playground exposing sensitive information, please file
a ticket so we can remove it.
